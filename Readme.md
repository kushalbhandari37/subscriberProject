1.  Clone the project first then run "npm install" to install all the dependancies.
2.  All the necessary config examples are updated on .env.example file. Please check the file and add necessary configs.
3.  Run the server using "nodemon"

Note:
I have used Nodemailer for Email functionality. Update values on .env file accordingly.
